description: End-of-session summary following Polya's review step
---

Output a session retrospective:

**DONE:** (what was completed — specific files, PRs, test results)

**WORKED:** (what approach or tool was effective this session)

**BLOCKED:** (what slowed progress — errors, scope creep, missing info)

**NEXT:** (remaining work, suggested starting point for next session)

Rules:

- Each section max 2 lines
- Total max 10 lines
- Be specific: file names, error counts, PR numbers — not vague summaries
