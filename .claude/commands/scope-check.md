description: Check if current session is staying within its original scope
---

Review the conversation so far and answer:

1. What was the original task/goal stated at the start of this session?
2. What am I currently working on?
3. Are these the same thing? If not, what caused the drift?
4. Should I: (a) finish current work and return to original goal, (b) abandon the detour and refocus, or (c) the detour is actually more important — redefine the session goal?

Be honest. Scope creep is the #1 reason sessions end with "partially achieved".
