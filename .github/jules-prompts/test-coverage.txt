Your task is to improve test coverage for the OpenVital codebase (Rust CLI).

Workflow:
1. Identify core modules lacking test coverage
   (prioritize business logic in src/core/ over thin command handlers in src/cmd/)
2. Pick 1 file/module per run and write unit tests for it
3. Tests should cover: happy path, boundary conditions, error handling paths

Requirements:
- Follow the project's existing test style:
  - Unit tests use #[cfg(test)] mod tests inside source files
  - Integration tests go in tests/ directory, exercising the full pipeline with temp databases
- Test names should describe the behavior being tested, not implementation details
- Only mock external I/O (filesystem, database) — not internal modules
- PR title format: [jules-test] Add tests for <module name>
- All new tests must pass

OpenVital project conventions:
- Build verification: cargo check && cargo fmt --all -- --check && cargo clippy -- -D warnings && cargo test
- All four commands must pass before creating a PR (matches CI pipeline)
- Follow Conventional Commits format: type(scope): description
- Never modify CHANGELOG.md (managed by release-please)
- Integration tests use temp databases — see tests/ for patterns
