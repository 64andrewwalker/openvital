Check the OpenVital codebase for documentation-code inconsistencies.

Review:
1. README.md usage examples — do they still work with current CLI commands?
2. CLAUDE.md CLI commands table — does it match actual commands in src/cli.rs?
3. CLAUDE.md architecture section — does the source tree layout match actual files?
4. docs/openvital-spec.md — are feature descriptions consistent with implementation?
5. Configuration file comments — do they describe actual current behavior?

Cross-check README commands table against src/cli.rs enum variants to find mismatches.

Before creating a PR, check if an open PR with title prefix "[jules-docs]"
already exists. If one does, add a comment to that PR with your findings
instead of opening a new PR.

Actions:
- Fix factually incorrect documentation: create a PR
- PR title format: [jules-docs] Update <file/module> documentation
- Only fix factual errors — do NOT rewrite for style
- If large sections of documentation are missing entirely:
  create an Issue with "jules-created" label rather than writing it yourself
  (inaccurate documentation is worse than no documentation)

OpenVital project conventions:
- Build verification: cargo check && cargo fmt --all -- --check && cargo clippy -- -D warnings && cargo test
- All four commands must pass before creating a PR (matches CI pipeline)
- Follow Conventional Commits format: type(scope): description
- Never modify CHANGELOG.md (managed by release-please)
- Integration tests use temp databases — see tests/ for patterns
