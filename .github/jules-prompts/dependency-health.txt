Audit the health of the OpenVital project's Rust dependencies.

Focus areas:
1. Security vulnerabilities: run `cargo audit` to identify high and critical severity CVEs
2. Outdated dependencies: check `cargo outdated` for core dependencies with major version gaps
3. Deprecation warnings: check for crates or APIs marked as deprecated

Actions:
- For security-patching patch/minor upgrades: create a PR with the upgrade
- For major upgrades requiring breaking changes: create a GitHub Issue with "jules-created" label
  explaining the risk, migration effort, and recommended timeline — do NOT upgrade directly
- PR title format: [jules-deps] <description>
- Ensure the project builds and all existing tests pass after upgrades
- Maximum 3 dependency upgrades per PR to keep diffs reviewable

OpenVital project conventions:
- Build verification: cargo check && cargo fmt --all -- --check && cargo clippy -- -D warnings && cargo test
- All four commands must pass before creating a PR (matches CI pipeline)
- Follow Conventional Commits format: type(scope): description
- Never modify CHANGELOG.md (managed by release-please)
- Integration tests use temp databases — see tests/ for patterns
